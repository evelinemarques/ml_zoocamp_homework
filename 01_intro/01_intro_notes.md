## 1.1 Introduction to Machine Learning
Predicting the price of car;

Machine learning to solve the problem: the best price to announce a car for selling.
What do we know about cars? year, make, mileage -> Price.
An expert can determine the price. They learn from data and extract some patterns.
Machine Learn: dataset that the model extract patterns.

**Features**: informations about the car

**Target**: what we want to predict: car price

With all the information we train a model.
The model is able to  predict the price car when given the car information;
**Machine Learning**: extracting patterns from data. Data two types: features, target. output is the Model. **Model** encapsulate all the patterns
